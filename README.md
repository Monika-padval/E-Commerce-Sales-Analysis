Excel-based E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power Query &amp; Power Pivot


# **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard**
The “E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard” project involved a comprehensive analysis of transactional sales data to evaluate business performance and uncover meaningful insights. Using Microsoft Excel, this project applied structured data cleaning, modeling, KPI analysis, and interactive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making in an e-commerce environment.
Through systematic analysis and dashboard design, the following key insights and visual components were developed:
# **Sales & Performance Analysis**: 
The project evaluated overall sales performance using key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Orders, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV). These KPIs provided a clear snapshot of business health and customer purchasing behavior.

# **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth Analysis**:
A detailed YOY comparison was implemented to measure growth trends across multiple years. This analysis enabled the identification of performance improvements and ensured accurate time-based evaluation using a dedicated Date dimension.

# **Category-wise Sales & Contribution Analysis**:
Sales performance was analyzed across different product categories to understand their contribution to overall revenue. Bar, doughnut, and waterfall charts were used to highlight top-performing categories and their relative impact.

# **Monthly Sales and AOV Trend Analysis**:
A combination chart was used to track monthly sales trends alongside Average Order Value, providing insights into seasonal patterns and changes in customer spending behavior over time.

# **Customer & Demographic Analysis**:
Interactive slicers allowed filtering of data by Year, Gender, and Product Category, enabling deeper exploration of customer demographics and purchasing patterns.

# **Interactive Dashboard & KPI Monitoring**:
A centralized dashboard was designed to bring together all KPIs and visualizations. The dashboard updates dynamically using slicers, ensuring real-time interactivity and a seamless user experience.

The E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard project demonstrates a strong application of Excel Power Query for data preparation, Power Pivot for data modeling, and PivotTables and PivotCharts for analysis and visualization. By maintaining transactional data integrity and implementing a star schema design, the project ensures accuracy, scalability, and professional analytical standards.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable insights through structured analysis and effective visual storytelling, supporting informed business decisions and performance optimization.
